# LeetCode Difficulty Masker üöÄ

As an avid **LeetCode** enthusiast, I understand how the difficulty tags can sometimes discourage problem-solving. To address this, I've developed a _Chrome extension_ that masks these tags, encouraging users to tackle problems without bias.

## Features

- üîç Replaces "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard" difficulty tags with "ü§î" on LeetCode.
- üöÄ Dynamically processes new content as it loads on the page.
- üåê Lightweight and straightforward to install.

## How It Works

The extension employs a content script to identify and modify the text content of elements on the LeetCode page. It monitors changes in the DOM to ensure all newly loaded content is processed.

### Tech Stack

- **JavaScript**: The core language for the extension.
- **Chrome Extensions API**: The framework used to develop the extension.
- **HTML**: Utilized in the extension's manifest file.
